# GIMP-configs
My configurations for using GIMP in a Photoshop-like workflow. Based on [PhotoGIMP](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP).

## Included
- [SLOS Gimpainter](https://github.com/SenlinOS/SLOS-GIMPainter)
- Some color pallets from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list)
- Custom shortcuts and interface (similar to Photoshop)
